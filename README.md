# hunting-words
> hunting-words game generator

Because I didn't have anything better to do, I started this repo
to practice Ruby :heart:.

## How-to

The algoritm today generate a matrix and populates with random chars.
Given a input of words it will try to add one-by-one into the matrix.

To run:
```bash
~/path/to/project$ ruby ./hunting-words.ruby
```

The output will be similar to:

```
r u w s d s b l j g
d u u s m z x z m d
a g c a r r o x i f
a z k s a p a t o m
v g s t v f e s f g
l h k k g p u j j a
x o c m j b z x p b
u m e y j i w r r p
y e w f m f s f e l
s a o e t g v v y m
```

## Roadmap

* fix word override
* add inverse order word insertion
